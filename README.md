# Hi, I'm Theophilus ADEWALE
**Founder & Builder** | Currently: AwaChapter (Voice-first legacy preservation infrastructure)

I am building the social infrastructure for future cities. Currently, I am the Founder of **AwaChapter**—a voice-first, AI-powered platform transforming how families, groups, and diaspora communities preserve and publish their authentic legacies.

###  What I'm Building: AwaChapter
Traditional memory-keeping fails because it demands solitary effort, long writing sessions, and ignores oral traditions. AwaChapter fixes this by rebuilding legacy from the voice up. 

* **The Problem:** 78% of family heritage vanishes in three generations.

* **The Solution:** A collaborative "Narrative Engine" that captures raw voice inputs, normalizes code-switching and accents, and weaves multi-perspective stories into a Phygital (Physical + Digital) VoiceBook.

###  My Technical Focus & Unfair Advantage
I specialize in taking complex, multi-modal data (Voice, Text, Image) and building elegant, event-driven architectures that produce tangible, consumer-ready outputs.

Building infrastructure for:
- Voice/video capture and synthesis
- Multi-contributor collaboration systems
- AI-powered narrative generation
- Cross-platform accessibility

* **Frontend:** React Native (Mobile), Next.js (Web)
* **Backend & Infra:** Supabase, Edge Functions, PostgreSQL
* **Intelligence Layer:** LLM Orchestration, STT pipelines, Narrative Synthesis
**Systems Design:** Event-driven architecture, Async "multiplayer" state management

###  Artectural Philosophy
I build for scale, durability, and zero-friction user experiences.
*(See AwaChapter-Core for my implementation of decoupled transcription and narrative synthesis).*
